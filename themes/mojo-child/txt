You're a front-end dev working on a vibe-coded homepage for a cutting-edge company called **Mojo AI Services**.

Here’s what you need to build:

---

## 🎨 Style & Theme
- Match the **Mojo AI logo** (attached: curved ocean-tech shape, deep blue, teal, neon gradients) (please reference the "logo.png" file)
- Use a **dark background** (#0f0f0f or similar)
- Primary accent: electric blue, gradient cyan, neon yellow
- Fonts: Sleek sans-serif (Inter, Poppins, or similar)

---

## 🛠️ Layout Structure

### 1. HERO SECTION
- Full-screen hero
- Logo top center (use `<img src="/wp-content/themes/mojo-child/assets/logo.png">` as placeholder)
- H1: “Mojo AI Services”
- Subheading: “AI Consulting • Smart Home Installations • IT Support”
- Animated aurora-like **text glow** or **hover shimmer** across the headings

### 2. FEATURES SECTION
Three responsive feature cards:

| Icon | Heading | Text |
|------|---------|------|
| 🧠 | AI Consulting | Personalized AI integration services for your daily life or business|
| 🤖 | Shelby Smart Hub | Voice-controlled energy optimizer Coming soon... |
| 🛠️ | IT Support | On-demand tech help for home or office |

Cards should:
- Have soft-glow hover effects
- Use glassmorphism or neon border styling

### 3. CALL TO ACTION
- “Ready to make your home smarter?”
- Button: “Let’s Build Something”

---

## 🌀 Animation & Vibe

- Add subtle **animated aurora light trails** behind hero text (or as page background)
- Glow/blur gradients that move slightly on scroll or idle
- Animate in feature cards with **scroll reveal**
---

## 📁 Output Format

Give me a complete:
- `front-page.php` (using `get_header()` and `get_footer()`)
- `style.css` section to inject into my child theme
- Optional: custom JS or CSS keyframes for effects

---

## 🧠 Constraints

- Built for WordPress
- Do not use page builders or Elementor
- Must be responsive
- Use semantic, accessible HTML

Let’s go full tech-chic with a futuristic vibe. Make it feel like OpenAI, Figma, and Tesla had a baby. Clean, modern, sharp.

Here’s a **Cursor-compatible prompt** based on your request that clearly defines your design vision, leverages the uploaded logo, includes the GitHub libraries, and articulates the aesthetics you want—using proper frontend development terminology to guide the AI assistant in Cursor:

**🎯 Prompt for Cursor AI: Build Shelby Site Homepage with Aurora-Themed Animation, Sidebar Nav, and Animated Text**

You're an expert UI engineer and creative frontend designer. Use the PNG logo I uploaded as the central brand reference. I need you to build a homepage for my company **Mojo AI Services**, which offers cutting-edge smart home AI systems (Shelby + Sunny) and IT consulting. I want the **theme, layout, and colors to match the uploaded logo**, so extract the color palette directly from that file (dominant tones, accent colors, etc.).

### 💡 Website Concept:

The website should embody **fluidity and dynamic adaptability**—it must feel alive, modern, and tech-forward. Think flowing energy, ambient movement, and a futuristic but clean design.

### ✨ Aesthetic Inspirations:

Use the design language from:

* [A24 Films](https://a24films.com) — minimalist but bold, cinematic feel
* [Play.ai](https://play.ai) — futuristic and experimental
* [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com) — clean, centered on user flow
* [Unity](https://unity.com) — background motion, techy ambient visuals

---

### 📐 Layout Structure:

* **Navigation Sidebar (Left-aligned)**: Styled similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT layout

  * Tabs: `Consulting`, `SHELBY`, `SUNNY`, `IT Services`, `My Account`
  * Icons or hover tooltips optional
* **Main Hero Section** (center screen): Big intro text like:
  `“Welcome to the Future of Home Intelligence.”`
  Then subtext:
  `“Where AI adapts, energy saves, and your voice leads.”`
* **Animated Background**:

  * Use **Aurora.css** for flowing gradients or background effects
  * Subtle **video background or parallax** scroll effect if compatible

---

### 🧠 Animation Libraries (Include These):

* ✅ **Aurora.css** for soft background fluidity
* ✅ **Hover.css** for link and button effects
* ✅ **Animate.css** for text and section entry animations (e.g. fadeIn, bounceInUp)

---

### 🎨 Interactivity:

* Every **text element should animate on hover** using Animate.css (e.g., `pulse`, `lightSpeedIn`, or `rubberBand`)
* Buttons can have hover.css effects like `grow` or `underline-from-center`
* Logo at top-left corner of sidebar, **with transparent background** (extract from PNG — avoid boxy white background)

---

### 📲 Responsiveness & Framework:

* Use **Tailwind CSS** for layout and utility classes
* Use **React + JSX** or **Next.js** as foundation (whichever you prefer)
* Fully **mobile-responsive** and **dark-mode friendly**

---

### 🛠️ Action:

Start by generating the **homepage layout**, import the three animation libraries, extract the logo color scheme, and implement the sidebar nav with animated hover text. Include a central animated welcome text with Aurora-style background. Keep everything modular and scalable.
